# 💊 Unused Medicine Donation System

The **Unused Medicine Donation System** is a desktop-based C# Windows Forms application developed as a semester project at FAST-NUCES. It provides a platform for individuals to donate their unused medicines to help those in need. The system enables secure user registration and login, medicine donation, admin-based approval, and inventory management. All data including users, medicine records, and feedback is stored using `.txt` files, eliminating the need for a database setup and making the system lightweight and easy to deploy.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in modular Windows Forms development, file handling, and user-centric design in C#.
